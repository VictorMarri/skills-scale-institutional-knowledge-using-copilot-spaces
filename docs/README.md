## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme manages projects with a clear, consistent lifecycle:
- **Initiation:** Validate problems/opportunities and define success metrics and stakeholders.
- **Planning:** Break work into deliverables, identify risks, create milestone maps.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Rapid delivery in small increments, daily team syncs, CI testing, and transparent blocker escalation.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, provide regular status updates, escalate issues via defined paths.
- **Release & Deployment:** Follow standardized checklists and incident playbooks for dependable launches.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Run structured retros after milestones or incidents; track and celebrate real improvements.
- **Roles & Personas:** Every role has clearly documented responsibilities to support decision-making and collaboration.

Guiding principles:
- Customer-centric, iterative delivery
- Ownership and accountability

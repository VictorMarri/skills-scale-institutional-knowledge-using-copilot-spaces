# OctoAcme Risk Review Process

## Purpose
Provide a standardized process for identifying, tracking, and mitigating project risks across all OctoAcme initiatives.

## Roles
- **Project Manager:** Facilitates the review and ensures action items are tracked.
- **Team Leads:** Report new risks and mitigation progress.
- **Stakeholders:** Approve major mitigation actions when impact is high.

## Cadence
- Weekly during execution.
- As needed during initiation and planning.

## Steps
1. **Identify** – Capture risks with description, likelihood, impact, and owner.  
2. **Assess** – Prioritize using a simple matrix (Low / Medium / High).  
3. **Plan** – Define mitigation or contingency actions with due dates.  
4. **Review** – Revisit status weekly and escalate high-impact risks.  
5. **Close** – Mark resolved risks and record lessons learned.

## Artifacts
- Risk register entry (id, title, owner, severity, status, next action).  
- Meeting notes with decisions and follow-up tasks.
